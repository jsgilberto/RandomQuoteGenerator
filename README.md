# Random Quote Generator
## Built a Random Quote Generator
In this project I used a mix of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and React.

## Install
Make you sure you have installed Node (if not, you can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)).

Clone the repo to your computer:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jsgilberto/RandomQuoteGenerator.git
$ cd RandomQuoteGenerator
$ npm install
```

## Usage
Once you have the repo in your local computer, go into the repo and run the following command:
```
$ npm start
```
It will open a window in your browser and you are ready to go!
